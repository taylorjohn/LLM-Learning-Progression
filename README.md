# GPT Model Progression Repository

## Introduction

This repository provides a step-by-step progression of **Language Models** (LMs), from **unigram models** to the advanced **GPT-3** architecture. Each stage includes explanations, exercises, and solutions to help learners understand the concepts behind each model and how to implement them in **Rust**.

This repository is structured to facilitate learning through:
- **Model descriptions**: Each model has a dedicated README file.
- **Exercises**: Practical exercises to solidify understanding.
- **Solutions**: Example solutions to exercises, helping learners check their work.

## How to Use the Repository

1. **Start with the basics**: Begin with the **unigram model** to understand how simple language models work.
2. **Progress step-by-step**: Follow the models in sequence—**unigram**, **bigram**, **N-gram**, and then **RNN** and **LSTM**—before advancing to transformers and GPT models.
3. **Do the exercises**: Each model directory contains **exercises** to help you implement the models and solidify your understanding.
4. **Check the solutions**: Once you’ve completed the exercises, refer to the **solution files** to verify your work or get help with tricky problems.

## Next Steps

Once you've completed this progression, you can explore additional models and tasks such as:
- **GPT-Neo** or **GPT-J** for larger transformer models.
- **Fine-tuning** on specific datasets for more advanced tasks like text summarization, translation, or domain-specific generation.
