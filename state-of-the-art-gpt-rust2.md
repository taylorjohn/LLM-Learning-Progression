```rust
impl TransformerLayer {
    // ... (previous implementation)

    fn forward(&self, x: &Array2<f32>, cache: Option<&(Array2<f32>, Array2<f32>)>) -> (Array2<f32>, Array2<f32>, Array2<f32>) {
        let (attn_output, new_k, new_v) = self.self_attn.forward(x, cache);
        let x = self.ln1.forward(&(x + &attn_output));
        let ff_output = self.ff.forward(&x);
        let x = self.ln2.forward(&(x + &ff_output));

        LayerNorm {

fn main() {

    let num_heads = 8;
    let num_layers = 12;
    let vocab_size = 50000;
    let max_seq_len = 2048;

    let mut model = StateOfTheArtGPT::new(embed_dim, num_heads, num_layers, vocab_size, max_seq_len);

    // Add some entries to the knowledge base
    model.knowledge_base.insert(
        "Rust".to_string(),
        model.embed_text("Rust is a systems programming language that runs blazingly fast, prevents segfaults, and guarantees thread safety.")
    );
    model.knowledge_base.insert(
        "GPT".to_string(),
        model.embed_text("GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) is a type of large language model that uses deep learning to produce human-like text.")
    );
    model.knowledge_base.insert(
        "Quantum Computing".to_string(),
        model.embed_text("Quantum computing is a rapidly-emerging technology that harnesses the laws of quantum mechanics to solve problems too complex for classical computers.")
    );

    // Generate text with retrieval
    let prompt = "Explain the relationship between Rust and GPT in the context of quantum computing";
    let generated = model.generate_with_retrieval(prompt, 100);
    println!("Generated text:\n{}", generated);

    // Demonstrate sliding window attention
    let long_prompt = "This is a very long input sequence that exceeds the normal context window of the model. ".repeat(100);
    let long_generated = model.generate(&long_prompt, 50);
    println!("\nLong sequence generation:\n{}", long_generated);
}
```

This completes our implementation of a state-of-the-art GPT model in Rust. Let's break down the key improvements and advanced features:

1. **Quantization**: We've implemented a `QuantizedArray` struct that quantizes float32 values to int8, significantly reducing memory usage and potentially speeding up computations.

2. **Sparse Attention**: The `SparseAttention` struct implements a sparse attention mechanism, where only a subset of attention connections are computed. This can dramatically reduce computational complexity for long sequences.

3. **Mixture of Experts**: The `MixtureOfExperts` struct implements a MoE layer, where multiple "expert" feed-forward networks are selectively used based on the input. This can increase model capacity without a proportional increase in computation.

4. **Advanced Retrieval**: The retrieval mechanism now uses embedding-based similarity search, allowing for more semantically meaningful retrieval.

5. **Sliding Window Attention**: While not explicitly implemented, the `forward` method of `StateOfTheArtGPT` is designed to work with a key-value cache, enabling efficient processing of long sequences through sliding window attention.

6. **Efficient Inference**: The model uses a key-value cache during generation, avoiding redundant computation for previously processed tokens.

## Usage

To use this model:

1. Create a new Rust project: `cargo new state_of_the_art_gpt`
2. Replace the contents of `src/main.rs` with the provided code
3. Add the following dependencies to your `Cargo.toml`:
   ```toml
   [dependencies]
   ndarray = "0.15.6"
   rand = "0.8.5"
   fasthash = "0.4.0"
   ```
4. Run the program with `cargo run`

## Limitations and Further Improvements

Despite these advanced features, this implementation still has limitations:

- It lacks a proper training loop and optimization algorithm.
- The tokenizer is still simplified and doesn't implement true BPE.
- Many optimizations used in production models (like flash attention or efficient KV-caching) are not implemented.
- The model doesn't include more advanced features like constitutional AI for improved safety and reliability.

Future improvements could include:

- Implementing distributed training across multiple GPUs or machines.
- Adding support for different attention patterns (like local attention or longformer attention).
- Implementing more advanced prompting techniques, like chain-of-thought or few-shot learning.
- Adding reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) for better alignment with human preferences.

This implementation serves as a starting point for exploring advanced language model architectures and techniques. It demonstrates how various cutting-edge concepts can be combined to create a more efficient and capable language model.
