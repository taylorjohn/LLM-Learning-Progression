Let's continue with the Python implementation (train_gpt.py):

```python
def train(model, train_dataset, val_dataset, config):
    optimizer = torch.optim.AdamW(model.parameters(), lr=3e-4, betas=(0.9, 0.95), weight_decay=0.1)
    scheduler = torch.optim.lr_scheduler.CosineAnnealingLR(optimizer, T_max=len(train_dataset), eta_min=1e-5)

    train_loader = DataLoader(train_dataset, batch_size=config.batch_size, shuffle=True)
    val_loader = DataLoader(val_dataset, batch_size=config.batch_size)

    for epoch in range(config.num_epochs):
        model.train()
        total_loss = 0
        for batch in train_loader:
            x, y = batch
            x, y = x.to(device), y.to(device)
            optimizer.zero_grad()
            logits, loss = model(x, y)
            loss.backward()
            torch.nn.utils.clip_grad_norm_(model.parameters(), 1.0)
            optimizer.step()
            scheduler.step()
            total_loss += loss.item()

        avg_loss = total_loss / len(train_loader)
        print(f"Epoch {epoch+1}/{config.num_epochs}, Train Loss: {avg_loss:.4f}")

        model.eval()
        val_loss = 0
        with torch.no_grad():
            for batch in val_loader:
                x, y = batch
                x, y = x.to(device), y.to(device)
                logits, loss = model(x, y)
                val_loss += loss.item()

        avg_val_loss = val_loss / len(val_loader)
        print(f"Validation Loss: {avg_val_loss:.4f}")

        # Generate sample text
        context = torch.zeros((1, 1), dtype=torch.long, device=device)
        generated = model.generate(context, max_new_tokens=100, temperature=0.8, top_k=40)
        decoded = train_dataset.tokenizer.decode(generated[0].tolist())
        print(f"Generated sample: {decoded}")

def main():
    # Load the tokenizer
    tokenizer = BPETokenizer.load("tokenizer.txt")

    # Load your text data
    with open("your_text_data.txt", "r") as f:
        text = f.read()

    # Create config
    config = GPTConfig(
        vocab_size=len(tokenizer.encoder),
        block_size=128,
        n_layer=6,
        n_head=8,
        n_embd=256,
        dropout=0.1
    )

    # Create datasets
    full_dataset = TextDataset(text, config.block_size, tokenizer)
    train_size = int(0.9 * len(full_dataset))
    val_size = len(full_dataset) - train_size
    train_dataset, val_dataset = torch.utils.data.random_split(full_dataset, [train_size, val_size])

    # Create model
    model = GPT(config).to(device)

    # Training configuration
    train_config = type('TrainConfig', (), {
        'batch_size': 64,
        'num_epochs': 10,
    })()

    # Train the model
    train(model, train_dataset, val_dataset, train_config)

    # Save the model
    torch.save(model.state_dict(), "gpt_model.pth")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Now, let's explain the key components and optimizations in this implementation:

1. **Efficient Tokenizer**: The Rust implementation of the BPE tokenizer provides fast tokenization, which is crucial for processing large amounts of text data.

2. **MPS Backend**: We're using the Metal Performance Shaders (MPS) backend for PyTorch, which is optimized for Apple Silicon GPUs. This allows us to leverage the M2's GPU for faster training.

3. **Model Architecture**: The GPT model is implemented with a modular structure, allowing for easy modifications and extensions. We're using multi-head attention and layer normalization, which are key components of the transformer architecture.

4. **Optimization Algorithm**: We're using AdamW optimizer with weight decay, which has been shown to work well for transformer models. The learning rate is scheduled using a cosine annealing schedule, which helps in better convergence.

5. **Gradient Clipping**: We're using gradient clipping to prevent exploding gradients, which can be an issue when training deep networks.

6. **Efficient Data Loading**: We're using PyTorch's DataLoader with shuffling for efficient batch processing and to ensure variability in training.

7. **Validation and Sample Generation**: After each epoch, we evaluate the model on a validation set and generate a sample text, allowing us to monitor both quantitative and qualitative performance.

To use this implementation:

1. Ensure you have Rust and Python installed on your MacBook Air M2.
2. Compile and run the Rust tokenizer:
   ```
   cargo run --release
   ```
3. Install the required Python packages:
   ```
   pip install torch torchvision torchaudio
   ```
4. Prepare your text data in a file named "your_text_data.txt".
5. Run the Python script:
   ```
   python train_gpt.py
   ```

This implementation should efficiently utilize your MacBook Air M2's GPU for training. The use of the MPS backend allows for significant speedups compared to CPU training.

Remember that the performance will depend on the size of your dataset and the model. You may need to adjust the model size (number of layers, embedding dimension, etc.) based on your available memory and desired training time.

Further optimizations could include:

1. Implementing data parallelism if you have multiple GPUs.
2. Using mixed precision training (e.g., float16) for further speed improvements.
3. Implementing checkpoint saving and loading for resuming training.
4. Adding early stopping based on validation loss to prevent overfitting.

This implementation provides a solid foundation for training GPT models on a MacBook Air M2, balancing efficiency with the hardware's capabilities.
