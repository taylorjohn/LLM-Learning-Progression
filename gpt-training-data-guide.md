# Training Data Guide for GPT Model Progression

This guide provides recommendations for training data to use with each model in our GPT progression. When specific examples are not provided, you can use these suggestions to test and demonstrate the capabilities of each model.

## 1. Unigram Model

**Recommended Data**: A small corpus of simple sentences or phrases.
**Example**:
```
The cat sat on the mat.
Dogs bark loudly.
Birds fly in the sky.
Fish swim in water.
People walk on streets.
```

**Size**: 50-100 sentences
**Complexity**: Very low, focus on common words and simple structures

## 2. Bigram Model

**Recommended Data**: Short paragraphs or sets of related sentences.
**Example**:
```
The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. The dog barks at the fox. The fox runs away quickly. The lazy dog goes back to sleep.
```

**Size**: 200-300 sentences
**Complexity**: Low, but with some word relationships

## 3. N-gram Model

**Recommended Data**: Longer paragraphs or short articles.
**Example**: Use simple Wikipedia articles or children's stories.

**Size**: 1000-2000 sentences
**Complexity**: Medium, with varied sentence structures and vocabulary

## 4. N-gram Model with Backoff

**Recommended Data**: A mix of common phrases and less common constructions.
**Example**: Combine simple news articles with some specialized text (e.g., scientific abstracts).

**Size**: 2000-5000 sentences
**Complexity**: Medium to high, with some rare word combinations

## 5. Feed-Forward Neural Network Language Model

**Recommended Data**: A diverse corpus of text from various sources.
**Example**: Combine news articles, Wikipedia entries, and simple literature.

**Size**: 10,000-50,000 sentences
**Complexity**: High, with a wide range of topics and styles

## 6. Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) Language Model

**Recommended Data**: Longer coherent texts with sequential dependencies.
**Example**: Full news articles, short stories, or book chapters.

**Size**: 50,000-100,000 sentences
**Complexity**: High, with emphasis on long-range dependencies

## 7. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Language Model

**Recommended Data**: Similar to RNN, but with even longer coherent texts.
**Example**: Full books, long-form articles, or collections of related documents.

**Size**: 100,000-500,000 sentences
**Complexity**: Very high, with complex long-range dependencies

## 8. Transformer Language Model

**Recommended Data**: Large, diverse corpus with a wide range of topics and styles.
**Example**: Combine books, articles, websites, and forums across various domains.

**Size**: 1-5 million sentences
**Complexity**: Very high, with diverse topics and language usage

## 9. Simplified GPT

**Recommended Data**: Similar to Transformer, but potentially larger.
**Example**: Use a subset of a large-scale web crawl or a curated dataset like WebText.

**Size**: 5-10 million sentences
**Complexity**: Extremely high, covering a wide range of internet text

## 10. Advanced GPT

**Recommended Data**: Large-scale, diverse corpus from multiple sources.
**Example**: Combine web crawls, books, articles, code, and specialized texts.

**Size**: 10-50 million sentences
**Complexity**: Extremely high, with multi-domain knowledge

## 11. M2-Optimized GPT

**Recommended Data**: Similar to Advanced GPT, but potentially filtered or curated for quality.
**Example**: Use a high-quality subset of a large language model training corpus.

**Size**: 50-100 million sentences
**Complexity**: Extremely high, focusing on high-quality, diverse text

## General Guidelines for Selecting Training Data:

1. **Diversity**: Ensure a mix of topics, styles, and sources appropriate to the model's complexity.
2. **Quality**: For simpler models, use clean, well-structured text. For advanced models, include more varied and realistic language use.
3. **Size**: Increase the corpus size as models become more complex and capable.
4. **Domain Relevance**: If training for a specific application, include domain-specific text in addition to general language data.
5. **Ethical Considerations**: Be mindful of biases in the training data, especially for more advanced models.
6. **Copyright**: Ensure you have the right to use the selected texts for training.

When using this guide, adjust the recommendations based on your specific needs and computational resources. For the more advanced models, you may need to use publicly available datasets or create a custom web scraping pipeline to gather sufficient data.
